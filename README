Stacked Letters is a jQuery plugin that simply stacks letters on top of each other. The subtelty (or lack of!) of the effect depends on the CSS you apply to the text.

All you need to get started is:

    $('#elementId').stackedLetters();

with the correct letter-spacing and text-shadow CSS properties, this can give you a great effect.
